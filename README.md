# Comments for r3ply site

This repository is a git submodule that's pulled in by the [r3ply site](https://github.com/asimpletune/r3ply/tree/main/site) when being built.

Although it adds a little extra complexity, it ensures that comments are better separated from the main project (which is a monorepo).
