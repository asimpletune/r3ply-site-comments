<p>I hold 3% sweat equity in a service-oriented startup, and the founder is offering to buy it back since I am no longer involved with them. Based on his forecast $600k in revenue and a market-sector average of 6% profit, he estimates $36k profit this year, and thus a valuation of $72k, making my 3% worth $2160. Is this a common experience among developers?</p>
